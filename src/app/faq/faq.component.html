               <h3><strong>About the PackAd Network</strong></h3><br>
               <h4><strong>What is the PackAd network?</strong></h4>
               <p>The PackAd network is a commercial network platform built on an ecommerce and marketing model we call “Free Ad for a Discount” In this platform where businesses gets to list their discounted products or services at no cost to them, and in return the business gets to post a free Ad for each item they list. Consumers in the network determine the amount of exposure the Ads gets by liking or not liking the deals. More likes means more Ad exposure, and less likes means less exposure.  If the percentage of likes drops to a certain threshold then the free Ad associated with the deal is suspended until seller boosts discount.</p>
               <p>For consumers the network enables you to shop, get great prices, interact and meet other consumers, and possibly make new friends. For businesses the network enables you to sell your products or services at no cost, interact with consumers, and cut your marketing costs by running Ads for free...yes, not a typo, it’s FREE and will always be FREE!</p>
               <h4><strong>Does PackAd the company sell anything?</strong></h4>
               <p>No PackAd the company does not sell anything. We just provide the platform for businesses to sell their products or services.</p>
               <h4><strong>What is PackAd’s dynamic networking model and how does it differ from Social networks?</strong></h4>
               <p>Unlike social and professional networks like Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin where you interact with a static group of people in your network, the PackAd network is dynamic and different. Dynamic in the sense that the people you interact with at a given time can change depending on your commercial preferences and activities. This model is designed to emulate consumer’s everyday commercial experience. For instance when a consumer goes to a restaurant they can meet and interact with other consumers in that restaurant and potentially make new friends, but when they leave that restaurant and go to maybe a supermarket their network changes from the restaurant people to now the consumers in the supermarket where they can meet, interact and potentially make new friends as well. In essence, consumers connect to and disconnect from other consumers in their ever changing daily commercial experiences. This changing real life dynamic commercial networking model based on a consumer’s commercial activities is what the PackAd network provides.</p>
               <h4><strong>What can I use the PackAd network for?</strong></h4>
               <p>The PackAd network is built to be the ultimate platform for ecommerce interaction between consumers and consumers, and consumers and businesses. As a consumer you can use the network to meet and interact with other consumers with similar commercial interest or need and potentially make new friends, interact with businesses selling their products or services in the network, and of course shop for good or services at greatly discounted prices. As a business you can use the network to meet and interact with buyers and potential buyers of your products or services, sell your goods or services, and of course run Ads for free..yes you heard it correctly, run Ads for FREE.</p>
               <h4><strong>How is the PackAd network different from traditional ecommerce sites?</strong></h4>
               <p>Traditional ecommerce sites presents platform for consumers to strictly buy things. PackAd network on the other hand provides a platform for consumers to engage with other consumers and businesses from the time they have an idea about buying something to long after they have bought it.</p>
               <h4><strong>What are commercial groups?</strong></h4>
               <p>It is how we group consumers and businesses who are interested in a particular product or service category for interactions, shopping, selling and marketing. For example a consumer user who is interested in buying a car and a business user who sells a car will join a commercial group dedicated for auto sale.</p>

               <h3><strong>PackAd for Consumers</strong></h3>
               <h4><strong>Can consumers use PackAd network?</strong></h4>
               <p>Yes. PackAd is built for both consumers and businesses.</p>
               <h4><strong>Can I shop for products and services?</strong></h4>
               <p>Yes. PackAd is designed to be used for selling and shopping of virtually any consumer product or services. However different categories of products and services will be launched for use at different periods as we grow our network.</p>
               <h4><strong>Can I meet and interact with other consumers?</strong></h4>
               <p>Yes. PackAd is the ultimate consumer to consumer interaction platform that is built to allow consumers to engage with other consumers and businesses from the point a consumer is thinking about potentially buying an item to long after the item has been purchased.</p>
               <h4><strong>How do I shop for things?</strong></h4>
               <p>In order to shop you will need to join a commercial group for the product/service category of the item you are interested in. For example if you want to shop women apparel you will need to join a commercial group for it”. Once joined you will be able to interact with other shoppers interested in women apparel, and see all women apparel items posted by sellers for sale at a discounted price. If you see anything you like you can add it to cart and checkout.</p>
               <h4><strong>Can I return or exchange something I have bought?</strong></h4>
               <p>As PackAd the company does not sell any item, we leave it to each individual seller in our network to set their exchange and return policy. So if a seller accepts returns and exchanges then yes you can return or exchange a purchased item.</p>
               <h4><strong>Is shipping free on PackAd?</strong></h4>
               <p>It depends on the seller.</p>

               <h3>PackAd for Businesses</h3>
               <h4><strong>PackAd for Businesses</strong></h4>
               <p>Yes. PackAd is built for both consumers and businesses.</p>
               <h4><strong>How can I sell on the PackAd network?</strong></h4>
               <p>It’s simple. You connect to a commercial group for the item you want to sell, then create and post the item to the group. Once posted all the consumers who have connected to the same group because of their interest in the product or service will see the item and can buy it. One of the great thing about selling on PackAd is that it costs you nothing to sell…It’s free.</p>
               <h4><strong>What can I sell on the PackAd network?</strong></h4>
               <p>The network is designed to be used for any consumer products or services.  Not all categories will be available initially but will be rolled out gradually.</p>
               <h4><strong>How do I get paid for the things I sell on the PackAd network?</strong></h4>

               <h3><strong>Network Interactions</strong></h3>
               <h4><strong>Can I as a consumers interact with other consumers and how?</strong></h4>
               <p>Yes you can. The beauty of the model is that it is built to emulate your everyday commercial experiences. For example when you walk into a café you essentially are connected to other consumers in that café, and can interact with them and possibly make new friends. And when you leave the café you essentially disconnect from those people. The pattern continues for your daily commercial activities. So this is what we try to emulate in our network through commercial groups, where you can connect and disconnect from other consumers and businesses based on your commercial interest.</p>
               <h4><strong>Can I as a business interact with consumers and how?</strong></h4>
               <p>Of course, in the same manner as consumers as indicated above.</p>
               <h4><strong>PackAd networking model is dynamic so does that mean that people I interact with can change?</strong></h4>
               <p>Yes you control who you interact with and for how long by connecting and disconnecting from commercial groups.</p>

               <p>You essentially determine how long your Ad runs. An Ad is tied to a sale item so the expiry date you set for the discount on that sale item is also the expiry date of the Ad. So when the sale item discount expires so does the Ad.</p>
